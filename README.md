# Iran Customized Time Zone without Daylight Saving

## Introduction
Due to Iran's government's decision to stop Daylight Saving starting from 20 March 2023 and the lack of an official update from Microsoft to address this change till this date, Lots of Iranians got into trouble with time contradiction.

## Resolution
We have provided a Windows Registry file and a Powershell script to add a new Timezone to Windows machines.

Both the Registry file and Powershell script will perform the same task. It's just a matter of your taste.

After running one of them, a new Timezone will be added to Windows and you can select it in Windows Setting like below:

It's possible to place one of these files in GPO for bulk updates.
